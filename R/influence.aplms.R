#' local influence of the object `aplms()`.
#'
#' Takes a fitted `aplms` object and outputs some diagnostic information about the fitting procedure and results. Returns the conformal normal curvature of the fitted `aplms` model object. The `case-weight`, `dispersion`, `response`, `explanatory`, and `corAR` perturbations are available.
