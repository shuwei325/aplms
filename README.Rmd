# aplms

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `aplms` is fitting Additive partial linear models with symmetric errors.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aplms from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shuwei325/aplms")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(aplms)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
